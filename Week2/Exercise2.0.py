print('It is subjective based on the needs of the user. Certain users may find that any size project benefits from using version management software. Other users might not benefit until they have reached a barrier. Having an online community available to check your code and provide feedback is an amazing resource. In terms of storage, GitHub recommends that repositories remain small, ideally less than 1 GB, and less than 5 GB is strongly recommended. Smaller repositories are faster to clone and easier to work with and maintain.')
